SolAR Fiducial Marker
=============

SolAR is an open-source framework released under Apache license 2.0 making possible to easily create your own camera pose estimation solution to develop Augmented Reality applications. 
SolAR is dedicated to Augmented Reality (AR).
It offers a C++ SDK to easily and quickly develop and use custom solutions for camera pose estimation. It provides developers with a full chain from low-level vision components development to camera pose estimation pipelines and AR service development.

The SolAR Fiducial Marker samples show a SolAR pipeline for augmented reality based on a fiducial marker.

To run it, first print the marker "FiducialMarker.gif".

Then, run whether the SolARFiducialSampleStandAlone.exe (showing a standalone demonstration based on a fiducial marker), or the TestFiducialMarkerPlugin.exe (showing an application loading the fiducial marker pipeline embedded into a SolAR Module).

Press escape to quit the application.

If you want to change your fiducial marker, you can edit the fiducialMarker.yml.

If you want to change the calibration parameters of the camera, edit the camera_calibration.yml.

To change properties of the components of the fiducial pipeline, edit the xml files.
